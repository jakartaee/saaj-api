/**
 * A container for {@code DetailEntry} objects. {@code DetailEntry}
 * objects give detailed error information that is application-specific and
 * related to the {@code SOAPBody} object that contains it.
 *<P>
 * A {@code Detail} object, which is part of a {@code SOAPFault}
 * object, can be retrieved using the method {@code SOAPFault.getDetail}.
 * The {@code Detail} interface provides two methods. One creates a new
 * {@code DetailEntry} object and also automatically adds it to
 * the {@code Detail} object. The second method gets a list of the
 * {@code DetailEntry} objects contained in a {@code Detail}
 * object.
 * <P>
 * The following code fragment, in which <i>sf</i> is a {@code SOAPFault}
 * object, gets its {@code Detail} object (<i>d</i>), adds a new
 * {@code DetailEntry} object to <i>d</i>, and then gets a list of all the
 * {@code DetailEntry} objects in <i>d</i>. The code also creates a
 * {@code Name} object to pass to the method {@code addDetailEntry}.
 * The variable <i>se</i>, used to create the {@code Name} object,
 * is a {@code SOAPEnvelope} object.
 * <pre>{@code
 *    Detail d = sf.getDetail();
 *    Name name = se.createName("GetLastTradePrice", "WOMBAT",
 *                                "http://www.wombat.org/trader");
 *    d.addDetailEntry(name);
 *    Iterator<DetailEntry> it = d.getDetailEntries();
