== Appendix B: Change History

=== Changes in Version 3.0

* `SOAPElementFactory` has been removed
* `SOAPConnection.call` is no longer required to support `javax.xml.messaging.URLEndpoint`
* Provider lookup through `jaxm.properties` is removed

=== Changes in Version 2.0

* Changed specification version and license.
* Changed package name to `jakarta.xml.soap`

=== Changes in Maintenance Release 4

The fourth maintenance release of SAAJ, SAAJ
1.4, clarifies and extends the SAAJ 1.3 specification.The goal of this
maintenance release proposal is primarily to adopt changes in Java SE
Platform and to make a few corrections and clarifications on the
existing SAAJ 1.3 APIs. The proposed API changes in SAAJ 1.4 are
backward compatible with SAAJ 1.3 APIs.

The "accepted changes", as specified in JSR067
changelog, have been incorporated in this document. The key changes are
as follows:

* Changed the definition of the discovery process of SAAJ implementation.
* Added support for generics where applicable.
* Changed MAY to MUST in jakarta.xml.soap.SOAPElements methods.
* Several corrections and clarifications have been made to the JavaDocs for the API.

=== Changes in Maintenance Release 3

The third maintenance release of SAAJ, SAAJ 1.3,
clarifies and extends the SAAJ 1.2 specification.The goal of this
maintenance release proposal is primarily to provide support for SOAP
version 1.2 Message Constructs and to make a few corrections and
clarifications on the existing SAAJ 1.2 APIs. The proposed API changes
in SAAJ 1.3 are backward compatible with SAAJ 1.2 APIs.

SOAP version 1.2 has a number of changes in
syntax and provides additional (or clarified) semantics from those
described in SOAP 1.1. This proposed changes in this maintenance release
are concerned with the following areas:

* Support for SOAP version 1.2 message constructs in the API.
* Factoring out the creation of all SAAJ Factory classes
into a single SPI that allows creation of SOAP version aware Factories.
* Addition of a few new classes and new methods in
certain existing classes and interfaces.
* Support for overloaded QName based methods in
certain classes and interfaces.
* Clarification of semantics and correction of
wording of JavaDocs and specification

A brief summary of the proposed changes follows:

* Support for SOAP Version 1.2 message constructs
in the API: SOAP Version 1.2 has a number of changes in syntax and
introduces several new Message Constructs. SAAJ 1.3 will support SOAP
Version 1.2 Message Constructs.

* SPI for Creation of Factory Instances: SAAJ 1.3
will support SOAP Version 1.2 Message Constructs, while at the same time
being backward compatible in its support for SOAP Version 1.1. We would
like to define an SPI (SAAJMetaFactory) for factoring out the creation
of SOAP Version aware Factory classes into a single place. Changing out
the SAAJMetaFactory has the effect of changing out the entire SAAJ
implementation. Backward compatibility is maintained by ensuring that
the default protocol is set to SOAP Version 1.1.

* Definition of new Class SAAJResult: A SAAJResult
object acts as a holder for the results of a JAXP transformation or a
JAXB marshalling, in the form of a SAAJ tree. This class will make it
easier for the end user when dealing with transformations in situations
where the result is expected to be a valid SAAJ tree.

* Addition of overloaded methods which accept a
QName instead of a Name: QName is the preferred representation of XML
qualified names, and hence we would like to introduce overloaded methods
in all APIs where a corresponding method was accepting a
jakarta.xml.soap.Name as argument. The Name interface may be deprecated in
a future release of SAAJ in favor of QName.

* Clarify and correct the wording of JavaDocs and
specification: None of these changes will break backward compatibility
for SOAP 1.1 users. Corrections of this nature cost little and improve
the overall integrity of the specification making correct
implementations easier to create, validate and use.

* Addition of new methods in certain Interfaces
and Classes: A few new methods have been introduced in AttachmentPart,
SOAPBody, and SOAPElement. These new methods are intended for ease of
use and to assist SAAJ users when dealing with some of the newer SOAP
features.

* Making SOAPPart a jakarta.xml.soap.Node: The
SOAPPart is also a SOAP Node.

Deferred Changes:

* The deprecation of Name
Interface has been deferred to a later release.
* DOM Level 3 Support: Implementations of SAAJ 1.3
must provide support for DOM Level 3 APIs.

=== Changes in Maintenance Release 2

The second maintenance release of SAAJ, SAAJ
1.2, clarifies and extends the SAAJ 1.1 specification. The "accepted
changes", as specified in the Change Log forSOAP with Attachments API
for Javaâ„¢, have been incorporated into this document. A summary of the
changes follows:

* The core SAAJ classes and interfaces: `Node` ,
`SOAPElement` , `SOAPPart` , and `Text` now extend the equivalent
interfaces in the `org.w3c.dom` package: `Node` , `Element` , Document
and `Text` respectively.

* The ability to get and set properties on
`SOAPMessage` has been added to `SOAPMessage` in order to facilitate
extensibility and two new properties have been added in order to take
advantage of this extensibility: `CHARACTER_SET_ENCODING` allows the
character encoding to be set to "utf-8" or "utf-16" where "utf-8" is the
default. Implementations may optionally support other character
encodings. `WRITE_XML_DECLARATION` allows clients to specify whether or
not an XML Declaration will be written at the start of the SOAP part of
the message. The valid values are "true" and "false" with "false" being
the default.

* Several APIs have been extended in order to
provide greater ease of use. The `Node` interface has gained a
`setValue` () method. `SOAPFault` has been enhanced with several methods
that facilitate the handling of its sub-elements. `SOAPMessage` ,
`SOAPElement` , `SOAPBody` and `SOAPHeader` have all been given new
methods that enhance navigation of the tree. A removeContents() element
has been added to `SOAPElement` in order to assist in the construction
of messages that contain a fault.

* Several corrections and clarifications have been
made to the JavaDocs for the API.

This specification has been derived from the
`javax.xml.soap` package originally defined in the JAXM 1.0
specification. The "accepted changes," as specified in JSR067 changelog,
have been incorporated in this document. The key changes are as follows:

* `javax.xml.soap` package was moved from the
JAXM specification to this document. In the interest of consistency and
for simplifying synchronization of specifications, this document has
been designated as version 1.1 of the SAAJ specification. There are no
prior versions of the SAAJ specification.

* The `call` method signature of the
`SOAPConnection` object has been modified so as to remove the dependency
of SAAJ on JAXM.

* The `newInstance` method of
`SOAPConnectionFactory` may throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`
hence making the implementation of the `SOAPConnection.call()`
functionality optional.

* The `SOAPElementFactory` has been deprecated and
a new "super" factory for creating `Element` , `Detail` , and `Name`
objects created. The previous `SOAPElementFactory` methods now delegate
to the appropriate `SOAPFactory` methods.
