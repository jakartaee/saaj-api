== Introduction

This specification was developed following the
Java™ Community Process (JCP2.10). Comments from experts, participants,
and the broader developer community were reviewed and incorporated into
this specification.

The SOAP with Attachments API for Java Specification, version 1.1 was a
maintenance release of the Java™ API for XML Messaging (JAXM) 1.0
specification. JAXM 1.0 was the final deliverable of JSR067 Expert Group
(EG). The proposed changes specified in the JSR067 changelog and
accepted on 15 April 2002, have been incorporated into this document.

The proposed changes specified in the second
JSR067 changelog and accepted on 23 April 2003, have been incorporated
into this document as SOAP with Attachments API for Java Specification, version 1.2.

The proposed changes specified in the third
JSR067 changelog have been incorporated into this document as SOAP with Attachments API for Java
Specification, version 1.3.

The proposed changes specified in the fourth
JSR067 changelog have been incorporated into this document as
SOAP with Attachments API for Java Specification, version 1.4.

Starting with Jakarta SOAP Attachments Specification, Version 2.0, 
this document is developed under https://jakarta.ee/about/jesp/[Jakarta EE Specification Process]

=== Terminology

References in this document to SAAJ refer to the Jakarta SOAP with Attachments API
unless otherwise noted.

The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL,
SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they
appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
as quoted here:

MUST: This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or
"SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the
specification.

MUST NOT: This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL
NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the
specification.

SHOULD: This word, or the adjective
"RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular
circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications
must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different
course.

SHOULD NOT: This phrase, or the phrase "NOT
RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular
circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful,
but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully
weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.

MAY: This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL",
mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include
the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the
vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit
the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular
option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation
which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced
functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a
particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another
implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for
the feature the option provides.


== Preface


=== Audience

This document is intended for developers using
the Java™ programming language who wish to produce and consume messages
conforming to the SOAP 1.1, and SOAP 1.2 specification and the SOAP
Attachments Feature.

Familiarity with the SOAP specifications
(including the associated processing model), MIME standards, and XML is
assumed.



=== Abstract

Jakarta SOAP with Attachments defines an API enabling developers to produce 
and consume messages conforming to the SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2 and SOAP Attachments Feature.

In the interest of backward compatibility, Jakarta SOAP Attachments Specification
continues to offer a client-side communication capability enabling
developers to communicate in a point-to-point and request-response
manner with SOAP services bound to HTTP. This communication capability,
within the context of the Jakarta SOAP Attachments Specification specification,
is optional. However, specifications depending on Jakarta SOAP Attachments Specification
are free to require support for the SOAP to HTTP binding.

== Package Overview


This chapter presents an overview of the Jakarta SOAP Attachments
which consists of the single package; `jakarta.xml.soap` . The intent here
is to provide an overview of the package only, the details of which can
be found in the following chapter.

The `jakarta.xml.soap` package provides the
primary abstraction for SOAP Messages with MIME attachments. Attachments
may be entire XML documents, XML fragments, images, text documents, or
any other content with a valid MIME type. In addition, this package
provides a simple client-side view of a request-response style of
interaction with a SOAP service.

=== MessageFactory & SOAPMessage Objects

The `MessageFactory` class is used to create
`SOAPMessage` objects. Clients may create SOAPMessage objects by calling
the `MessageFactory.createMessage` method.

The `SOAPMessage` class is the root class for
all SOAP messages. Such messages must contain a single `SOAPPart` object
and may contain one or more `AttachmentPart` objects. The "on-the-wire"
encoding of a SOAP message is governed by whether the `SOAPMessage`
object includes `AttachmentPart` objects. If it does, the `SOAPMessage`
object is encoded as a MIME message otherwise it is encoded as a simple
XML message. Attachments may contain data of any type including XML. The
SOAPPart is always XML.

Jakarta SOAP Attachments allows for creation and consumption of
both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 messages by introducing the notion of
Protocol aware MessageFactories. The protocol here refers to a
particular version of SOAP. For example a SOAP 1.2 aware MessageFactory
can be obtained by calling the MessageFactory.newInstance method and
passing it the appropriate protocol identifier. The allowed protocol
identifiers have been defined in SOAPConstants. For processing incoming
messages a special protocol identifier called DYNAMIC_SOAP_PROTOCOL can
be used to allow a Node to accept both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 messages.



=== SOAPPart & AttachmentPart

The `SOAPPart` object is a MIME part
containing the `SOAPEnvelope` object. The `SOAPEnvelope` object must
contain a single `SOAPBody` object and may contain a `SOAPHeader`
object.

A `SOAPMessage` object may contain zero or
more `AttachmentPart` objects. Each `AttachmentPart` object in turn
contains application-specific content and corresponding MIME headers.
The MIME headers consist of name/value pairs that are used to identify
and describe the content. For MIME content-types of `text/plain` ,
`text/html` and `text/xml` , the `DataContentHandler` object performs
the necessary conversions to and from the Java types corresponding to
the MIME types. Other MIME types can be supported by passing an
`InputStream` object (that contains the content data) to the
`AttachmentPart.setContent` method. Similarly, the contents and header
from an `AttachmentPart` object can be retrieved using the `getContent`
method. Depending on the `AttachmentPart` objects present, the returned
`Object` can be either a typed Java object corresponding to the MIME
type or an `InputStream` object that contains the content as bytes. The
`clearContent` method is a helper method intended to facilitate the
removal of all the content from an `AttachmentPart` object while leaving
the header information.

A Jakarta SOAP Attachments implementation must support the
following MIME types. Additional MIME types may be supported using the
`jakarta.activation.DataHandler` class and the Jakarta Activation Framework.

|===

Jakarta SOAP Attachments API provides methods for setting and getting
the Raw content of an Attachment. Methods have also been provided to get
the content as Base64 encoded character data. Additionally a
getAttachment method on the SOAPMessage provides for retrieval of an
Attachment referenced from a SOAPElement using an href attribute as
described in SOAP Messages with Attachments, or via a single Text child
node containing a URI as described in the WS-I Attachments Profile 1.0
for elements of schema type ref:swaRef

=== MimeHeader(s) Objects

The `MimeHeaders` class is a container for
`MimeHeader` objects and serves as an abstraction for the MIME headers
that must be present if an `AttachmentPart` object exists in a
`SOAPMessage` object.

The `MimeHeader` object is the abstraction for
a name/value pair of a MIME header. A `MimeHeaders` object may contain
one or more `MimeHeader` objects.

=== SOAP Element

The `SOAPElement` object is the base class for
all of the classes that model the SOAP objects defined by the SOAP1.1
and SOAP 1.2 specifications. A `SOAPElement` object may be used to model
the following:

* content in a `SOAPBody` object
* content in a `SOAPHeader` object
* content that can follow the `SOAPBody` object within a `SOAPEnvelope` object
* whatever may follow the detail element in a `SOAPFault` object

=== SOAPEnvelope & SOAPBody objects

The `SOAPEnvelope` object is a container
object for the `SOAPHeader` and `SOAPBody` portions of a `SOAPPart`
object. The `SOAPEnvelope` object must contain a `SOAPBody` object, but
the `SOAPHeader` object is optional.

The `SOAPEnvelope` and `SOAPBody` objects both
extend the `SOAPElement` object. The `SOAPBody` object models the
contents of the SOAP body element in a SOAP message. A SOAP body element
contains XML data that may determine how application-specific content
must be processed.

=== SOAPBodyElement & SOAPFault

`SOAPBody` objects contain `SOAPBodyElement`
objects that model the content of the SOAP body. An example of a
`SOAPBodyElement` is the `SOAPFault` object.

=== SOAPFaultElement & Detail

The `SOAPFaultElement` is used to represent
the contents of a `SOAPFault` object.

The `Detail` interface is a container for
`DetailEntry` objects that provide application-specific error
information associated with the `SOAPBody` object that contains it.

A `Detail` object is part of a `SOAPFault`
object and may be retrieved using the `getDetail` method of the
`SOAPFault` object.

The `DetailEntry` object extends `SOAPElement`
and models the contents of a `Detail` object.

=== SOAPHeader & SOAPHeaderElement

A `SOAPHeader` object is an abstraction of the
SOAP header element. A `SOAPHeader` object can be created using the
`SOAPEnvelope.addHeader` method. `SOAPHeader` objects can have only
`SOAPHeaderElement` objects as their immediate children. The
`addHeaderElement` method creates a new `HeaderElement` object and adds
it to the `SOAPHeader` object.

`SOAPHeader` and `SOAPHeaderElement` objects
both extend the `SOAPElement` object. A `SOAPHeaderElement` object
models the contents of the SOAP header of a SOAP envelope.

=== SOAPConnection & SOAPConnectionFactory

The `SOAPConnection` object represents a
simple client-side view of a request-response style of SOAP messaging. A
Jakarta SOAP Attachments client may choose to establish a synchronous point-to-point
connection to a SOAP service using the `createConnection` method of the
`SOAPConnectionFactory` object. Subsequently, a `SOAPMessage` may be
sent to a remote party using the call method on the `SOAPConnection`
object. Note that the call method will block until a `SOAPMessage`
object is received.

A Jakarta SOAP Attachments Specification based application may choose to use the
call method to implement the client side of a simple point-to-point
synchronous one-way message exchange scenario. In such a case, it is the
application’s responsibility to ignore the `SOAPMessage` object returned
by the call method because the `SOAPMessage` object’s only purpose is to
unblock the client. It is assumed that a one-way service will not return
a response to a request using the same connection when the
`SOAPConnection.call` method was used to send the request.

Jakarta SOAP Attachments Specification also provides support for the SOAP 1.2
Response Message Exchange Pattern
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part2-20030624/#soapresmep) via
the `SOAPConnection.get` method. This method can be used for pure
information retrieval, where the representation of an available
resource, identified by a URI, is fetched using a HTTP GET request
without affecting the resource in any way.

=== SOAPException object

The `SOAPException` object extends
`java.lang.Exception` and is used to signal SOAP level exceptions.

=== Node & Text objects

The `Node` object models a node (element) of a
DOM abstraction of an XML document.

The `Text` object extends `Node` and
represents a node whose value is text. A `Text` object may model either
text that is content or text that is a comment.

=== Name

The `Name` object models an XML name. This
interface provides methods for getting the local names,
namespace-qualified names, the prefix associated with the namespace for
the name, and the URI of the namespace.

Name objects are created using the
`SOAPEnvelope.createName` method.

=== SOAPFactory

This factory is intended primarily for
the use of application components or tools that require the capability
of inserting XML fragments into a SOAP Message. `SOAPFactory`
serves as a super factory for the creation of `SOAPElement` , `Name` ,
and `Detail` objects.

=== SAAJMetaFactory

This Factory is the access point for the
implementation classes of all the other factories defined in the Jakarta SOAP
Attachments API. All of the newInstance methods defined on factories in Jakarta
SOAP Attachments API defer to instances of this class to do the actual object
creation. The implementations of newInstance() methods (in SOAPFactory and
MessageFactory) that existed in SAAJ 1.2 have been updated to also
delegate to the SAAJMetaFactory when the SAAJ 1.2 defined lookup fails
to locate the Factory implementation class name.

`SAAJMetaFactory` is a service provider
interface. There are no public methods on this class.

=== SAAJResult

This concrete class acts as a holder for the
results of a JAXP transformation or a Jakarta XML Binding marshalling,
in the form of a Jakarta SOAP Attachments tree. This class will make it easier
for the end user when dealing with transformations in situations
where the result is expected to be a valid Jakarta SOAP Attachments tree.
The results can be accessed by using the getResult method.


== Package: jakarta.xml.soap


=== Description

Provides the API for creating and building SOAP
messages. This package is defined in the Jakarta SOAP
with Attachments Specification.

The API in the `jakarta.xml.soap` package allows
you to do the following:

* create a point-to-point connection to a specified endpoint
* create a SOAP message
* create an XML fragment
* add content to the header of a SOAP message
* add content to the body of a SOAP message
* create attachment parts and add content to them
* access/add/modify parts of a SOAP message
* create/add/modify SOAP fault information
* extract content from a SOAP message
* send a SOAP request-response message

In addition the APIs in the `jakarta.xml.soap`
package extend their counterparts in the `org.w3c.dom` package. This
means that the `SOAPPart` of a `SOAPMessage` is also a DOM Level 2
`Document`, and can be manipulated as such by applications, tools and
libraries that use DOM (see http://www.w3.org/DOM/ for more
information). It is important to note that, while it is possible to use
DOM APIs to add ordinary DOM nodes to a Jakarta SOAP Attachments tree,
the Jakarta SOAP Attachments APIs are
still required to return Jakarta SOAP Attachments types when examining or manipulating the
tree. In order to accomplish this the Jakarta SOAP Attachments APIs (specifically
`SOAPElement.getChildElements()`) are allowed to silently replace objects that are
incorrectly typed relative to Jakarta SOAP Attachments Specification requirements
with equivalent objects of the required type.
These replacements must never cause the logical
structure of the tree to change, so from the perspective of the DOM APIs
the tree will remain unchanged. However, the physical composition of the
tree will have changed so that references to the nodes that were
replaced will refer to nodes that are no longer a part of the tree. The
Jakarta SOAP Attachments APIs are not allowed to make these replacements if they are not
required so the replacement objects will never subsequently be silently
replaced by future calls to the Jakarta SOAP Attachments API.

What this means in practical terms is that an
application that starts to use Jakarta SOAP Attachments APIs on a tree after manipulating it
using DOM APIs must assume that the tree has been translated into an all
Jakarta SOAP Attachments tree and that any references to objects within the tree that were
obtained using DOM APIs are no longer valid. Switching from Jakarta SOAP Attachments APIs to
DOM APIs is not allowed to cause invalid references and neither is using
Jakarta SOAP Attachments APIs exclusively. It is only switching from using DOM APIs on a
particular Jakarta SOAP Attachments tree to using Jakarta SOAP Attachments APIs
that causes the risk of invalid references.

=== Discovery of Jakarta SOAP Attachments implementation

There are several factories defined in the
Jakarta SOAP Attachments API to discover and load specific implementation:

* SOAPFactory
* MessageFactory
* SOAPConnectionFactory
* SAAJMetaFactory

First three define newInstance() method which
uses a common lookup procedure to determine the implementation class:

* Checks if a system property with the same
name as the factory class is set (e.g. `jakarta.xml.soap.SOAPFactory`). If
such property exists then its value is assumed to be the fully qualified
name of the implementation class. This phase of the look up enables
per-JVM override of the Jakarta SOAP Attachments implementation.

* Use the service-provider loading facilities,
defined by the `ServiceLoader` class, to attempt to locate and load an
implementation of the service using the default loading mechanism.

* Finally, if all the steps above fail,
`SAAJMetaFactory` instance is used to locate specific implementation (for
`MessageFactory` and `SOAPFactory`) or platform default implementation is
used (`SOAPConnectionFactory`). Whenever `SAAJMetaFactory` is used, its
lookup procedure to get actual instance is performed.
